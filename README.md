This project analyzes the "Student Performance Factors" dataset to predict student exam scores. It demonstrates a complete machine learning workflow, progressing from a simple single-variable regression model to a more complex and accurate model utilizing multiple features.

## âœ¨ Key Features

- **Data Cleaning:** Handles missing values and standardizes data formats.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualizes data distribution and relationships between features using Matplotlib and Seaborn.
- **Simple Linear Regression:** Builds a baseline model to predict exam scores based solely on hours studied.
- **Polynomial Regression:** Explores non-linear relationships as a bonus task.
- **Advanced Modeling:** Implements a `RandomForestRegressor` that uses multiple numerical and categorical features for significantly improved prediction accuracy.
- **Feature Importance:** Analyzes and visualizes which factors have the most significant impact on student scores.
- **Model Evaluation:** Compares models using key regression metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and R-squared ($R^2$).
